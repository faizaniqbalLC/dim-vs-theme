# Dim vs Theme   

I took inspiration from the [Fortnite VS Code Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.fortnite-vscode-theme) and the [Coder Coder Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoderCoder.codercoder-dark-theme) themes.

## Customization

VSCode lets you customize any theme to use the colors you want, so if you want for example change this theme to have a darker background, you can add this to your settings:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
	"breadcrumb.background": "#000000",
	"editor.background": "#000000",
	"editorGutter.background": "#000000",
	"tab.activeBackground": "#000000"
}
```
